# ZoovTechnicalTest

This repository was created for a technical test from Zoov. 

The goal is to create a dashboard based on data generated from a python file. The business context for this exercise is a bike rental operator with a fleet of 1000 bikes over 5 different cities, focusing on the year 2020.

It includes the "main.py" file as well as an example of the csv file created from the said python program called "zoov_test.csv". The dashboard was created with Google Data Studio and is available here: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/353f4ddd-960c-4ddd-a823-ac4c84507026
